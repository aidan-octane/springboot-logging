# springboot-logging

Simple Spring Boot webapp from my internship at Ticketmaster that calls the SpotifyAPI for the purpose of learning about company technologies like logging, Prometheus, and Spring Boot. 
Web app is a random Shoegaze song generator. I couldn't get Prometheus working in my short time at the internship (I think because of trouble with the company-owned laptop and network
intricacies) but I fully implemented API logging and other related concepts.
